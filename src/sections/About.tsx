        Hi, I'm Vana! I'm a junior full-stack developer passionate about
        building web and mobile applications.
        <br />I use JavaScript and Node.js to create dynamic APIs, and React and
        React Native to craft polished frontends.
        <br /> I'm currently diving into TypeScript and exploring new frameworks
        and technologies to grow my skillset even further.
      </p>
      <p>
        I graduated from Northcoders, where I completed an intensive full-stack
        bootcamp and learned to turn ideas <br />
        into functional, maintainable applications through both solo and group
        projects. My work ranges from <br />
        interactive frontends to robust APIs, and I enjoy experimenting with new
        tools to create applications that are
        <br /> not just functional, but intuitive and enjoyable to use. I aspire
        to write clean, maintainable code
        <br /> and thoroughly test my work as I continue to develop my skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of coding, I love exploring nature, and my passion for 2D games
        has inspired me to try my hand at pixel art.
        <br /> I'm always learning new things and finding little ways to be
        creative along the way.
      </p>
